    <h1>Cairo's Three Techniques to Make Data Meaningful</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Use an index.</b> An index is a value you choose to compare all of the other data to, called an <b>index origin</b>. A common index to choose is a 0% change. This allows us to easily see when a change is negative, and when it is positive.</li>
      <li><b>Use a logarithmic scale.</b> In a logarithmic scale, the (usually) y-axis value is calculated by orders of magnitude, rather than simple number. For example, a base-10 logarithmic scale may have a y-axis ranging from 1 to 10. A 1 means that there was an increase of 10 (10^1), and a 10 means there was an increase of 10,000,000,000 (10^10). This allows us to more easily understand exponential increases.</li>
      <li><b>Account for subpopulations.</b> Your data may be skewed if you calculate the average of a population, while ignoring the differences between subpopulations. For example, an increase in life expectancy may not account for the fact that high-income earners are seeing an increase in life expectancy than low-income earners. This removes nuance, so the differences in subpopulations must be explained by the data visualization.</li>
